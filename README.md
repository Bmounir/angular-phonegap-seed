angular-phonegap-seed
=====================

A barebones seed project for getting started with PhoneGap and AngularJS (with routing!)

This project also includes a service for wrapping calls to Cordova APIs as presented by Brian Ford in [this awesome blog post](http://briantford.com/blog/angular-phonegap.html).

## Install

You just need to get these files into YourPhoneGapProject/www/, so either `git clone <url> www` or download the zip and move 'em in there. Note that I started from an iOS project on OS X 10.8.2, so act accordingly.

Directory structure:

```
/angular-phonegap-seed
    /css
        - index.css
    /img
        - logo.png
    /js
        - app.js
        - controllers.js
        - routers.js
    /lib
        - angular-1.1.5.js
        - angular-1.1.5.min.js
        - cordova-2.5.0.js
    /partials
        - main.html
        - view.html
    /res
        - whatever is in res
```

Build and run your project, and you should be good to go.

Be aware that I have made no attempt to make it look attractive. This may eventually be improved upon.
